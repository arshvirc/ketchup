As the developers of this app, we wanted to create the best to-do app on the market, covering all essential features, and more!\
The basics of the app include adding, editing, and deleting a task - create and add descriptions, deadlines, tags, and priorities for your todo items!\
Completed a certain task? Good job! Mark tasks as "completed" and have them accessible in the "Completed" tasks section.\
Deleted a task but changed your mind? No worries - head to the trash folder to restore a previously deleted item!
